# Theia Dentrite

A cloud-first IDE for documents

---

There's nothing to see here just yet. The real work is being on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/watheia]. This mostly exists to make the `minimal-mistakes` dependency [stop complaining about the site-repository](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/#site-repository), as git is currently unavailable in the minimalist builder image used in our Auto DevOps pipeline.

More information will become available once the project concludes the Elaboration Phase.
